# getcolo-do
This worker calls [getcolo.jldec.me](https://github.com/jldec/getcolo/blob/main/src/index.js) from the worker, from its durable object, and from its container. It uses the city as the name/id for the DO, so that you can reload your browser to see the non-cold-start latencies. Times are in _ms_.
